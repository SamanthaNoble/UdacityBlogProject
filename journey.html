      <h1>A Journey of a Thousand Miles...</h1>

      <p>
        ...begins with a single step. This is the first of (hopefully many!)
        blog posts that will follow my journey to become a Front End Web
        Developer. At this point, I have been enrolled in Udacity's Front End
        Web Developer class for about 2 weeks, and am building this blog as my
        first major project, hopefully testing my skills in both CSS and HTML
        more than my skills at blogging. In this post I want to go over two main
        things: 1) What I have learned and 2) my experience  and thoughts on this
        project so please join me.
      </p>
      <h2>The Class so Far</h2>
      <p>
        The front end web developer course is my first real experience with
        Udacity, and just completing  the first lesson has left a very good
        first impression in my mind. It moves so much faster than classes I have
        taken at university and simply going from learning what HTML is, to
        actually being able to make things appear on a page in just a few
        minutes felt like a breath of fresh air when compared to an hour and a
        half long lab that ended with just a page that said "Hello World". It
        keeps it extremely engaging and fun. Also, the suggestion to use VSCode
        from the start as opposed to something like Notepad++ also made learning
        syntax a lot easier.
      </p>
      <p>
        The HTML bit flew by, and so did the early CSS. Something that helped
        was having my own little HTML project where I could write similar things
        to what I was learning but with my own spin. And while that page full of
        little jokes and horribly clashing colors hopefully stays private, it
        did give me a lot of confidence to work on this project. The only bit
        where things seemed to slow down was the start of flexboxes, and CSS
        Grid. Some of it didn't click as quickly as the earlier lessons, but with
        enough time and practice that even became second nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think what the lessons taught me the most was actually confidence.
        Being able to see my code in action, being able to test it as well as
        having examples to know what it should like, showed me what was possible
        and that I very much had the skills to do it. I am a bit more nervous
        about going into the next part of the class, and learning about
        JavaScript, as it is much more of an actual programing language instead
        of the markup language  of HTML, but I think the strong foundation of this
        first lesson will really help that go much smoother.
      </p>
      <h2>This Blog</h2>
      <p>
        As alluded to, this was not my first time dabbling in CSS and HTML, but
        I am impressed with just how much better this website looks than
        anything I made before. Part of that is due to CSS Grid being so user
        friendly in comparison  to building things with tables, but still it
        looks a lot less GeoCities-esq than my previous attempts at web
        development. That said I was pretty sure with my more newbie set of
        skills it would end up with a decidedly retro feel to it. So with that I
        chose to model the website after a popular mid-thousands website that
        was important to me, right down to the pinks and purples of that
        website's design system. I think I did a good job in recreating the
        "vibes" of that place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Building it was a lot of fun, I liked formatting and seeing the work come
        together, as well as even using ProCreate to create a logo, so that I
        wouldn't have to rely on whoever reviews this project having the right
        fonts to be able to see my vision. I kind of got lost in development and
        in the end the hardest thing ended up being writing this blog post.
        (Despite the mid-thousands look of the website, I very much wanted to
        avoid my mid-thousands style of blogging, even if my ascii emoticon
        game was pretty hot) In the end I am proud of this. I ended up just
        having the Facebook and Twitter links go to their homepage as I don't
        really have a professional Social Media persona set up yet, (And I don't
        think future employers really want to see my old LiveJournal, if it even
        still exists that is!) Something to work on with this class. Well that
        wraps up what I wanted to share, next thing is to finish formatting  this
        website and move onto JavaScript! See you then!
